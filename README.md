### 30 Days of Code:

#### Please Note: 
- I have solved all these 30 Days of Code Problems with **Python** Language. If you are Comfortable coding with any other languages you   can add up to this repository if you wish to. 
- I came across this [nice post.](https://medium.com/startup-grind/30-days-of-coding-56f4e6c72aa2) which will make you not to give up if   you want to learn.
