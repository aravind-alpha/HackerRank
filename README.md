This Repository Contains Hackerrank Practice Solutions done by me which will be eventually updated frequently.

Currently This Repository Contains 30 Days of Code(in-progress) and SQL Completely.

- [30 Days of Code](#30-days-of-code)
- [SQL HackerRank Practice Solutions](#sql-hackerrank-practice-solutions)

### 30 Days of Code:

#### Please Note: 
- I am solving these 30 Days of Code Problems with **C and Python** Language. If you are Comfortable coding with any other languages you   can add up to this repository if you wish to. 
- I came across this [nice post.](https://medium.com/startup-grind/30-days-of-coding-56f4e6c72aa2) which will make you not to give up if   you want to learn.
