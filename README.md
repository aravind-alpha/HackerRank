This Repository Contains Hackerrank Practice Solutions done by me For 30 Days of Code (Done in C, C++, Python) and SQL which will be eventually updated to further Topics from HackerRank.

Currently This Repository Contains 30 Days of Code(in-progress) and SQL Completely.

### 30 Days of Code:

#### Please Note: 
- I am solving these 30 Days of Code Problems with **C, C++ and Python**. If you are Comfortable coding with any other languages you can   add up to this repository if you want to.
- I came across this [nice post.](https://medium.com/startup-grind/30-days-of-coding-56f4e6c72aa2) which will make you not to give up if   you want to learn.
